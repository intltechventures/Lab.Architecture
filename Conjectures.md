*Meeks Software Architecture Conjectures*
* #1: The source code may (or may not) be a full implementation of the desired capability needed by the business - but is more likely just an approximation (constrained by permitted time, allocated budget, and available skills/talent of the team involved). Therefore it should not be confused with the actual or desired (or envisioned) design - that may require multiple years to achieve - of which the current source code may only reflect a partial (and incomplete, or inaccurate) representation.


*Meeks Enterprise Architecture Conjectures*
* #101:  If you build an Enterprise Architecture  practice along the lines of an "Indy 500 Pit Stop service crew", you'll  have a better chance of providing the business with an "acceleration factor" - and achieving an agile architecture operational model, than if you are still working to implement EA practices along the lines of a construction permitting process.
