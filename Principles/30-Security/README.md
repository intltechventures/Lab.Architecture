1. Zero Trust is the First Security Principle. 

2. Security is always a question of trade-offs between risks vs. complexities vs. costs

3. Security is a shared responsibility. 

4. "Defense in Depth" is a foundational security practice. 

5. Data should be encrypted at-rest, and in-transit. 

6. Always assume the barbarians are at your gates - and likely already within your perimeter.

7. Assume any executable may contain an attack. 

8. Assume any request for access may be an attack. 

9. Assume any payload may be carrying an attack. 

10. There is no such thing as absolute security.
