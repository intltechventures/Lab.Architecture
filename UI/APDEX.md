  + "an open standard developed by an alliance of companies for measuring performance of software applications in
    computing. Its purpose is to convert measurements into insights about user satisfaction, by specifying a uniform way
    to analyze and report on the degree to which measured performance meets user expectations. It is based on counts of
    "satisfied", "tolerating", and "frustrated" users, given a maximum satisfactory response time t, a maximum tolerable
    response time 4t, and where users are assumed to be frustrated above 4t. The score is equivalent to a weighted
    average of these user counts with weights 1, 0.5, and 0, respectively."
