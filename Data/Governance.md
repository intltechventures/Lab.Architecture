# Data Governance Resources
- Caveat: I am just beginning to organize possible resources for this topic, and do not yet have a specific recommended book (or books) - yet. 
- Status: I will be adding some additional content to this topic through the end of July 2020...


## Standards
- ISO 11179 Metadata Registry (MDR) standard
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_11179


## Data Quality
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing#Data_quality
  + Validity: The degree to which the measures conform to defined business rules or constraints 
  + Accuracy: The degree of conformity of a measure to a standard or a true value
  + Completeness: The degree to which all required measures are known
  + Consistency: The degree to which a set of measures are equivalent in across systems
  + Uniformity: The degree to which a set data measures are specified using the same units of measure in all systems
