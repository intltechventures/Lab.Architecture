The Twelve Factors
1. One Codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
2. Explicity declare and isolate dependencies

4. Treat backing services as attached resources
5. Strictly separate services as attached resources
6. Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
7. Export services via port binding
8. Scale out via the process
