- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_and_Reaper
  + "Creeper was an experimental computer program written by Bob Thomas at BBN in 1971.[2] Its original iteration was
    designed to move between DEC PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system using the ARPANET, with a
    later version by Ray Tomlinson designed to copy itself between computers rather than simply move.[3] This
    self-replicating version of Creeper is generally accepted to be the first computer worm"
  + "The program was not actively malicious software as it caused no damage to data, the only effect being a message it
    output to the teletype reading "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!"[5][4]"
  + "Reaper was the first anti-virus software, designed to delete Creeper by moving across the ARPANET. It was created
    by Ray Tomlinson in 1972.[3]"
  + Thus, cybersecurity as a field was born
