## Ontology Examples

- Cyc
  + https://cyc.com/
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc
    * "a long-term artificial intelligence (AI) project that aims to assemble a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base that spans the basic concepts and rules about how the world works. Hoping to capture common sense knowledge, Cyc focuses on implicit knowledge. The project began in July 1984 at MCC and was developed later by the Cycorp company."
    * "The name "Cyc" (from "encyclopedia") is a registered trademark owned by Cycorp. CycL has a publicly released specification, and dozens of HL (Heuristic Level) modules were described in Lenat and Guha's textbook, but the Cyc inference engine code and the full list of HL modules are Cycorp-proprietary."
  + Obituary for the greatest monument to logical AGI (2025-04-01)
    * https://yuxi.ml/cyc/
      * "After 40 years, 30 million rules, 200 million dollars, 2000 person-years, and many promises, Cyc has failed to reach intellectual maturity, and may never will. Exacerbated by the secrecy and insularity of Cycorp, there remains no evidence of its general intelligence."
  + OpenCyc
    + "4.0 was the last released version, and around March 2017, OpenCyc was shut down for the purported reason that 'because such 'fragmenting' led to divergence, and led to confusion amongst its users and the technical community generally thought that OpenCyc fragment was Cyc.'"

- Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggested_Upper_Merged_Ontology
  + https://www.ontologyportal.org/
    * "The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) and its domain ontologies form the largest formal public ontology in existence today."
    * "SUMO is the only formal ontology that has been mapped to all of the WordNet lexicon. SUMO is written in the SUO-KIF language. SUMO is free and owned by the IEEE."

  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMBEL
  + "A logically organized knowledge graph of 34,000 concepts and entity types that can be used in information science for relating information from disparate sources to one another. It was retired at the end of 2019."
