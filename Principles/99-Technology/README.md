# EA Principles > Technology Architecture

1. All technologies MUST be associated to a Technical Reference Model (TRM). 

2. The TRM SHOULD minimally be defined to a category structure that is three levels deep. 

3. Technologies MUST NOT be mapped to a Level-1 category. 

4. There SHOULD usually be 8-12 Level-1 categories - but generally, not more than 16.

4. Technologies MUST NOT be mapped to a Level-2 category. 

5. There MUST NOT be more Level-1 categories than Level-2 categories, and NOT more Level-2 categories than Level-3 categories. 

6. All technologies MUST be mapped to the lowest leaf node of the TRM category structure (i.e., Level-3). 

7. All technologies SHOULD be managed within a lifecycle continuum. 

8. All technologies MUST have an approval/disposition status. 

9. Technologies SHOULD be periodically assessed for fit (e.g., Technical Fit, Business Fit). 

10. Technologies MUST be continually monitored/assessed for viability, performance, scalability, vulnerabilities, and security risks.
