# API Design Considerations

## Kelvin's Guiding Principles
- Do No Harm

- No single approach is correct

- Balance of Forces, must consider trade-offs:
  + Coupling
  + Chattiness
  + Client Complexity 
  + Cognitive Complexity 
  + Caching
  + Discoverability
  + Versioning 
  + Performance
  + Scalability
  + Reliability


## Other Design Guidelines

- [CTO Werner Vogels' 6 #API rules](https://thenewstack.io/werner-vogels-6-rules-for-good-api-design/):
  + APIs are Forever
  + Never Break Backward Compatibility
  + Work Backwards from Customer Use Cases
  + Create APIs That are Self Describing and Have a Clear, Specific Purpose
  + Create APIs with Explicit and Well-Documented Failure Modes 
  + Avoid Leaking Implementation Details at All Costs
