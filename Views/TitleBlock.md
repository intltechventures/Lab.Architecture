# EA Views - Title Block Ideas

I've begun drafting some ideas for what kind of information may be useful to include in a "[Title Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_drawing#Title_block)" for architecture diagrams. 

- I think that the current state (or, lack thereof) of annotating software design architectural drawings - is *abysmal* - and much might be gleaned by looking left-and-right - and seeing how other industries annotate their diagrams. 

- Problem Statement:
  + Diagrams that are exported from authoring tools, culled form PowerPoint, Visio, etc.  - *usually* do not have a proper "Title Block" included.
  + These diagrams are then uploaded to various places, emailed, shared, embedded (e.g. in PPT, Word, web sites, etc.).
  + Thus, the thread of context is lost - and they become orphans, once separated - with no clear traceability (i.e.  [Who, What, When, Where, Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws).
   
- I've done a brief survey of different Title Block styles - from various construction blueprints and building architecture diagrams - to gather some examples - as input to writing this document. 

- My current working draft (admittedly, I've "boiled the ocean" - and it is a bit of overkill. As always, take what works for you - and discard the rest):
