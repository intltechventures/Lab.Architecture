# Ideas for Possible Reporting Metrics
- Status: IDEATION - WORKING DRAFT

- For _most_ of these metrics - you could consider reporting Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Year-to-Date numbers...

- Micro Charts (or Sparklines) would also be useful - to visually illustrate the trendline
  + For example:

      * https://github.com/omnizach/d3-sparkline-chart
      * https://github.com/omnizach/d3-sparkline-chart#readme
