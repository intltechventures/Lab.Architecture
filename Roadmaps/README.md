## Introduction

When the topic of roadmaps arise, I find it useful to make a distinction
with respect to two dimensions, when deciding on the appropriate level of detail 
for roadmap artifacts:

- Audience
  + C-level executives
  + VP & Director-level leadership
  + Domain | Portfolio | Business Line

- Timeline
  + Long-term: Vision & Strategy
  + Interim: Initiatives & Plateaus 
  + Short-term: Tactical


## Structure of Roadmap Artifacts

1. Executive Presentation
2. Roadmap Visualization Diagrams
3. Roadmap Supporting Documents (elaboration detail, as needed)
   - By Domain | Portfolio | Business Line
     * Introduction
     * Overview - Big Picture
     * Key Initiatives 
     * Dependencies
     * Risks
     * Issues
     * Estimates
     * Timeline
     * References


## Key Information for Roadmap Visualization

- Major Initiatives (elements)

- Key Dependencies (assocative relationships)
  + For example:
    * Between Major Initiatives
    * With critical shared infrastructure, systems, applications, services, etc.
  + Considerations:
    * Trying to utilize different line styles (e.g., solid vs. dotted vs. dashed) - can become problematic when the number of relationship lines becomes dense, and auto-layout forces lines to overlay).


- Duration (length of element)
  + Suggestions:
    * Period boundaries (vertical demarcation of time) for a diagram to be defined as either YYYY, or YYY-Qn (e.g., 2023, 2024, 2025 - or 2023-Q1, 2023-Q2, etc.)

- Budget (color of element)
  + For example (info to be included in diagram legend):
    * White: TBD
    * Grey: No funding
    * Yellow: < $1M
    * Green: $1M-$2M
    * Blue: $2M-$5M
    * Red: $5M+

- Optionally:
  + Annotate a note (associated to an element, as needed)
    * For example:
      * Significant Pre-condition
      * Major Assumption
      * Major Concern
      * Significant Gaps 
  + Amount of data involved (height of element)
  + Highest data classifcation indicator involved in the Major Initiative effort
    * (e.g., a single character, capitalized, enclosed in brackets - at the end of the name of the element)


## Audience

### C-level
If you are preparing a roadmap for a C-level executive - you should try to limit 
the content of a presentation to no more than three slides:

- Summary
  + Motivation
  + Forces/Constraints
  + Goals & Objectives
  + Risks & Issues

- Diagrams
  + The Big Picture

- Supporting statements 
  + Estimates (costs, resources, time)
  + Dependencies
  
Invariably, additional supporting material will be requested - which can be managed 
in a supporting References presentation deck, or other suitable formats (e.g.,
wikis, Word documents, presentations, spreadsheets, diagrams, project plans, etc.)


### VP & Director-Level Leadership

- Diagrams
  + The Big Picture
  + Per Domain | Portfolio | Business Line 
    * (illustrative, not exhaustive...these will vary based on localized conventions)


### Domain | Portfolio | Business Line

- Diagrams 
  + Additional diagrams, as appropriate, at the Domain, Portfolio, Business Line, or Application level 



## Timeline Periods


### Long-Term

- In general, I would suggest limiting the maximum timeline for a roadmap to no more than 18-36 months. 
- However, I have seen 3-5 year roadmaps - but those usually grow stale very quickly. 


### Interim

- Typically, I try to aim for a timeline of 6-12 months for interim roadmaps.


### Short-Term

- Typically, I try to aim for a timeline of 3-6 than months for short-term roadmaps, but no more than 12 months.
