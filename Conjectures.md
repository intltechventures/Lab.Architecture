## Meeks Software Architecture Conjectures

1. The source code may (or may not) be a full implementation of the desired capability needed by the business - but is more likely just an approximation (constrained by permitted time, allocated budget, and available skills/talent of the team involved). Therefore it should not be confused with the actual or desired (or envisioned) design - that may require multiple years to achieve - of which the current source code may only reflect a partial (and incomplete, or inaccurate) representation.

2. For any non-trivial system, its behavior is probably not deterministic (as you may erroneously believe), but is more likely - stochastic.

3. Distributed Architecture is hard...and the complexity of the web of external dependencies is far beyond the ability of most teams to comprehend...

4. Assuming an ∞ budget - many fail to recognize that the business has little tolerance for ∞ rework.

5. "Change Blast Radius" is an important factor to consider when defending against the impetus to "code first, design later".

6. "Unintended consequences are inescapable".


## Meeks Enterprise Architecture Conjectures

101. If you build an Enterprise Architecture  practice along the lines of an "Indy 500 Pit Stop service crew", you'll  have a better chance of providing the business with an "acceleration factor" - and achieving an agile architecture operational model, than if you are still working to implement EA practices along the lines of a construction permitting process.

102. Much goodness would ensue, if we just got rid of the name EA. 


103. More enterprise projects fail due to an excessive degree of optimisim - than skipticism and pessimism.

104. If the actual data, from every major business that has attempted to follow the Agile Industrial Complex's prescriptive guidance were published and made available for aggreation and analysis - the entire edifice would immediately implode and spontaneously combust.


## Meeks 2024 GenAI Conjectures:

1. "Most business people driving enterprise-wide GenAI adoption in their company - are unqualified to have an opinion on AI."


2. "In ~18-24 months, 90% of those GenAI intiatives will be shutdown - and those same GenAI promoters in your company, will be gone (voluntarily, or involuntarily)."
